This comes without warranties, they are the scripts I use, they work for me and I'm sharing them. 

After a clean install of the x96 mini mad rom with x96mini_arm64_mad_beta5.img, I wait 11min for the mad scripts to work and then I use the one_click.bat script to install the pogo and atlas apks, update magisk to 23.0, install eMagisk and configure both atlas and eMagisk. If you are coming from a MAD setup, you may want to check https://github.com/dkmur/aconf instead of this repo. 


For it to work, you need the following files in the same folder:

* PokemodAtlas-Public-v22071801.apk

* com.nianticlabs.pokemongo_0.263.1-2023022801_minAPI24(arm64-v8a)(nodpi)_apkmirror.com.apk

* atlas_config.json (Example in git, don't edit the deviceName, it should be "dummy")

* emagisk.config (Example in git)

* DeviceIP.txt (Example in git)


Good luck :)
